For the AWS Credentials for this project, it should be set in the AWS CLI via the "aws configure" command. Additional AWS-related credential information may need to be set in "C:\Users\[user]\.aws\credentials" file like the region, and in my case, aws_session_token. The credential's access key and secret is advisably from an AWS IAM user with programatic and dynamo db full access.
